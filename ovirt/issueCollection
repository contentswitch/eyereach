1. Device eth0 does not seem to be present, delaying initialization

I was playing with My Virtualbox today and i tried to clone some Centos Servers. 
But after this, when starting the eth0, it is no more available.

check network:

# ifconfig
lo        Link encap:Local Loopback
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1
          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0
          RX bytes:0 (0.0 b)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 b)
 Try to start Eth0 device

# ifup eth0
Device eth0 does not seem to be present, delaying initialisation
To Solve this :

Delete networking interface rules file so that it can be regenerated and reboot your CentOS system.

# rm /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
# reboot
New Mac address has been generated:


# This file was automatically generated by the /lib/udev/write_net_rules
# program, run by the persistent-net-generator.rules rules file.
#
# You can modify it, as long as you keep each rule on a single
# line, and change only the value of the NAME= key.

# PCI device 0x8086:0x100e (e1000)
SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="08:00:27:fe:c1:03", ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="eth*", NAME="eth0"
Now edit /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0,

Add   new  HWADDR generated or  remove it 
Remove UUID   line
Restart the networking service

# service network restart
