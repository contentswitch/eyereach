1. rtmp publish
Usage: ./objs/sb_rtmp_publish <Options> <-u URL>
./objs/sb_rtmp_publish base on st(state-threads), support huge concurrency.
Options:
  -c CLIENTS, --clients CLIENTS    The concurrency client to start to request. defaut: 1
  -r URL, --url URL                The load test url for each client to download/process. 
  -t REPEAT, --repeat REPEAT       The repeat is the number for each client to download the url. 
                                   ie. rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live/livestream_{i}
                                   default: 0. 0 means infinity.
  -s STARTUP, --start STARTUP      The start is the ramdom sleep when  thread startup in seconds. 
                                   defaut: 5.00. 0 means no delay.
  -d DELAY, --delay DELAY          The delay is the ramdom sleep when success in seconds. 
                                   default: 1.00. 0 means no delay. -1 means to use HLS EXTINF duration(HLS only).
  -e ERROR, --error ERROR          The error is the sleep when error in seconds. 
                                   defaut: 3.00. 0 means no delay. 
  -m SUMMARY, --summary SUMMARY    The summary is the sleep when report in seconds. 
                                   etasks is error_tasks, statks is sub_tasks, estatks is error_sub_tasks.
                                   duration is the running time in seconds, tduration is the avarage duation of tasks.
                                   nread/nwrite in Mbps, duration/tduration in seconds.
                                   defaut: 30.00. 0 means no delay. 
  -v, --version                    Print the version and exit.
  -h, --help                       Print this help message and exit.

1. start a client
   ./objs/sb_rtmp_publish -i doc/source.200kbps.768x320.flv -c 1 -r rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live/livestream
